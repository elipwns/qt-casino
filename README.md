## Goal

To create a high-quality, free-to-play, online multiplayer casino Craps game for Android (and potentially other platforms) that offers a superior user experience by being **completely ad-free** and transparently fair, addressing common frustrations with existing solutions.

## Vision

Imagine a smooth, engaging Craps experience where players can connect with friends and strangers alike, placing bets with virtual currency, enjoying realistic dice rolls and animations, all without intrusive advertisements. The core emphasis is on fun, fairness, and community.

## Key Features & Requirements

* **Online Multiplayer:** Real-time interaction with other players at a Craps table.
* **Ad-Free Experience:** No banner ads, no interstitial ads, no video ads. Monetization through optional cosmetics:
  - **Table Themes:** Custom craps table backgrounds/themes that display to all players when you're the shooter
  - **Dice Skins:** Custom dice designs
  - **Chip Sets:** Personalized chip designs
  - **Virtual Chip Purchases:** Optional chip top-ups (core gameplay always remains free)
* **Free-to-Play:** Players create characters with different starting chip amounts (difficulty levels), with daily character reset option. No real money or cryptocurrency gambling.
* **High-Quality UI/UX:** Intuitive, visually appealing Craps table layout, smooth animations (dice rolls, chip movements), and clear display of game state and bets.
* **Fair & Transparent Randomness:** Ensuring dice rolls are genuinely random and perceived as fair by players.
* **Robust Backend:** Capable of managing game state, player data, and real-time communication securely.

## Technical Considerations & Proposed Stack

### 1. Frontend: Android Application

* **Framework:** **Qt (C++/QML)**
    * **Pros:** Cross-platform capabilities (potential for iOS, Desktop later), excellent performance with C++, powerful QML for creating fluid and animated UIs.
    * **UI:** QML will be used for declarative UI definition and animations.
    * **Game Logic Integration:** Core Craps rules and client-side interactions will be handled in C++.
* **Authentication:** **Google Sign-In (via JNI)**
    * Users can sign in using their Google accounts. This will require bridging Qt's C++ code with Android's Java/Kotlin APIs using JNI (Java Native Interface) for Google Play Services integration.

### 2. Backend: Game Server

* **Necessity:** A dedicated backend server is **essential** for online multiplayer. It acts as the authoritative source for game state, preventing cheating and ensuring all players experience the same, fair game.
* **Real-time Communication:** **WebSockets** (e.g., using Qt's `QtWebSockets` module for a C++ server, or a Node.js/Python/Go backend with WebSocket libraries).
* **Game State Management:** Server-side logic to handle all Craps rules, validate bets, process rolls, and manage payouts.
* **Player Management:** User accounts, lobbies, matchmaking, persistent virtual chip balances, and player statistics will be managed on the server with a suitable database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Firebase Firestore).

### 3. Randomness Implementation

* **Core Principle:** All dice rolls will be generated on the **server-side** using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).
* **Unique Seeding Idea: Public Blockchain Data**
    * The server will periodically fetch public, unpredictable data (e.g., **block hashes** from Bitcoin or Ethereum, or similar public blockchain data) from a reliable blockchain API.
    * This blockchain data will serve as a source of entropy to **seed** the server's CSPRNG, adding an external, publicly verifiable element to the randomness.
    * **Note:** This does *not* involve real crypto gambling or transactions within the game. It merely leverages the public nature of blockchain data for randomness.
* **Transparency & Trust: Provably Fair System (Planned)**
    * To build maximum player trust, the game aims to implement a "provably fair" system.
    * This involves the server committing to a hashed outcome *before* a roll, allowing players to contribute a "client seed," and then revealing all components (server seed, client seed, blockchain data used) *after* the roll, enabling players to independently verify the fairness of the outcome.

## Challenges & Workload

Developing a project of this scope is significant:

* **Complexity:** Integrating game logic, real-time networking, platform-specific features (JNI), and a robust backend.
* **Development Time:** Realistically, this is a **6-12+ month project** for a small, experienced team, or a long-term personal endeavor if developed solo.
* **UI/UX Polish:** Achieving a "high-quality" and "ad-free" experience requires significant attention to detail in design and animation.
* **Backend Scaling & Maintenance:** Ensuring the server can handle concurrent players and ongoing operational tasks.

**Compute Requirements Analysis:**

For a craps game server, compute needs are surprisingly light:

**Per Game Table (6-8 players):**
* **CPU:** ~0.1 vCPU (mostly idle, spikes during dice rolls)
* **Memory:** ~50MB (game state, player sessions)
* **Network:** ~1KB/s per player (WebSocket messages)

**Scaling Math:**
* **1 ECS task (0.25 vCPU, 512MB)** = ~5 concurrent tables = 30-40 players
* **Cost:** ~$9/month per task
* **1000 concurrent players** = ~25 tasks = ~$225/month

**Database Needs:**
* **Tables:** players, games, bets, transactions, cosmetics
* **Queries:** Simple CRUD, no complex analytics
* **Size:** ~1GB for 10k players with full history

**Monthly Infrastructure Costs:**
* **Database (t3.micro):** $13 (sufficient for 10k+ players)
* **Redis (t3.micro):** $15 (real-time game state)
* **ECS Tasks:** $9 per 30-40 players
* **Load Balancer:** $16
* **Data Transfer:** $20-50

**Cost Examples:**
* **100 concurrent players:** ~$80/month
* **500 concurrent players:** ~$150/month  
* **1000 concurrent players:** ~$290/month
* **5000 concurrent players:** ~$1200/month

**Development Phases:**
1. **Phase 1:** Single-player to local multiplayer (current)
2. **Phase 2:** Simple server with basic multiplayer
3. **Phase 3:** Full AWS deployment with auto-scaling
4. **Phase 4:** Advanced features (tournaments, leaderboards, analytics)

**Revenue Considerations:**
* **Break-even at 1000 players:** ~$0.29 per player per month
* **Cosmetic monetization:** Table themes ($2-5), dice skins ($1-3), chip sets ($1-3)
* **Character resets:** Premium characters, faster daily resets
* **Target:** 5-10% conversion rate, $2-8 average revenue per paying user
